# single_click_to_update_windows_time
This script will update your windows time to Any time Zone on a single click. 'Edit' the batch file to set your time zone and then run as administrator. By default, the time zone is set to Indian Standard Time.  I've provided one line commands to schedule this script to run at every boot.
